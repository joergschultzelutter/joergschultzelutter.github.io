The [BSI C5](https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Informationen-und-Empfehlungen/Empfehlungen-nach-Angriffszielen/Cloud-Computing/Kriterienkatalog-C5/kriterienkatalog-c5_node.html) attestation (Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria Catalogue) is an audit scheme for cloud services from the [German Federal Office for Information Security](https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Home/home_node.html) (BSI). It sets out the minimum security, transparency and compliance requirements that cloud providers must meet. Companies benefit from the verified reliability of cloud services, particularly in regulated industries. The certificate also makes it easier to compare different providers and can help to fulfill legal requirements. It serves as a guide for companies looking for secure cloud solutions.

In my role as C5 Manager and Cloud Compliance Manager, I was responsible for the implementation and realization of the C5 certificates Type1 / Type2 for several hyperscalers such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), a VMWare-based self-hosted virtual private cloud, and others.
