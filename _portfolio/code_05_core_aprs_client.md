core-aprs-client is based on [mpad](https://github.com/joergschultzelutter/mpad)'s original APRS-IS code and supports all basic features such as ACK'ing APRS requests with the proper formats, dupe detection, and beacon/bulletin messaging. However, its program code got heavily updated in multiple ways, such as storing all configuration parameters in an external config file. Apart from some very basic keywords, core-aprs-client does NOT provide any APRS-bot-specific functions. These functions can be added by the user who no longer has to concentrate on writing the data exchange between the bot and APRS-IS - but only has to write the code for the actual APRS bot's functions
