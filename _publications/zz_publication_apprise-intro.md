This article describes the use and configuration of the Apprise Multi-Messenger Platform Solution. Apprise is open source and was created in Python. A single call can be used to send messages to a wide variety of end devices via message or SMS; the call can be made either via the command line or via an API call.

I have developed two messenger modules for Apprise:
- [DAPNET pager](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/Notify_dapnet)
- [APRS (to ham radios)](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/Notify_aprs)
